An array is a collection of data values organized as an ordered collection of key-values pairs.

There are two kinds of array in PHP: indexed and associative.
The keys of indexed arrays are integers, beginning at 0.
Associative arrays have strings as keys and behave more like two-column tables.

PHP internally stores all arrays as associative arrays.

Storing a value in an array will create the array if it didn't already exist,
but trying to retrieve a value from an array that hasn't been defined won't create the array.
