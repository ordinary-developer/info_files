 common info
 ===========

 A document here is an analog of a row in relational databases.

 A document is an ordered set of keys with associated values.
 In javascript documents are represented as objects.
 {"greeting" : "Hello, world!", "foo": 3}

 The keys in a document are strings (UTF-8 encoding).

 MongoDB is type-sensetive and case-sensitive.
 MongoDB cannot contain duplicate keys.

 Key/value pairs in documents are ordered.
 But a field order does not usually matter and you should not design
 your schema to depend on a certain ordering of fields 
 (MongoDB may reorder them).
