 HANDLING EVENTS
 ###########################


 EVENT HANDLERS
 =======================
 each node (and also the "window" object) 
 has a method addEventListener()

 The "addEventListener" function registers its second argument
 to be called whenever the event described by its first argument occurs

 The "removeEventListener" method removes a handler


 Event handler functions are passed an argument: the event object.
 This object gives us additional information about the event.

 To stop receive events that happen in the children for parents nodes
 use the "stopPropagation()" method of the event object.

 To cancel a default action use the "preventDefault()" method
 for the event object

 "keydown", "keypress", "keyup" - key events
 "mousedown", "mouseup", "click" - mouse events
 "mouseout", "mousemove", "mouseover" - mouse motion events
 "scroll" - scroll event
 "focus", "blur" - focues event
