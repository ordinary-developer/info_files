 Commit guidelines
 -------------
 - do not submit any whitespace errors
   To identify possible whitespace errors (trail spaces) in your sources files
   before staging your files
   ---------------------------------
   | $ git diff --check	--color    |
   ---------------------------------
 
 - make each commit in a logically separate changeset
 
 - make correct messages
   Your messages should start with a single line that's no more about 50 characters
   and that describes the changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed
   by a more detailed explanation.
  
   in the body of the messages you can 
      include your motivation for the change
   and
      constrast its implementation with previous behaviour

   use the imperative present tense
   instared of "I added test for" use "Add tests for"
