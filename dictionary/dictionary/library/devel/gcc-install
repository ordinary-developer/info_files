## gcc-4.9 install

It is not easy to compile your gcc without any compiler,
so it is easier to install gcc (c compiler) from packages 
(your version may be not the same)
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9
```

to install g++ (c++ compiler)
(your version may be not the same):
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install g++-4.9
```    


## gcc-4.9 config

To use the binary files in your bash you can create some sym links:
```sh
$ make links from /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 to ~/shorcuts/gcc
$ make links from /usr/bin/g++-4.9 to ~/shorcuts/g++
```
