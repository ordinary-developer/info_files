 common info
 ===========

 A collection here is an analog of a table in relational databases.

 A collection is a group of documents.

 Collections have dynamic schemas. This means that the documents within
 a single collection can have any number of different "shapes".
 For example, both of the following documents could be stored 
 in a single collection:
 {"greeting" : "Hello, world!"}
 {"foo" : 5}

 Collection names can be any UTF-8 string, with a few restriction.



 subcollections
 ==============

 One convention for organizing collections is to use namespaced
 subcollections separated by the . character.
